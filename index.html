          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Tony Blankenship I currently attend WCCI (We Can Code It), a coding bootcamp where
            I study Java, Html, CSS, JavaScript and a few other accompanying languages. I attend the course
          remotely where we use mostly zoom and slack to communicate with eachother. My past job 
        experiences have all been warehouse distribution centers, it doesnt exactly give me any experiences
      towards a software job but it has gave me experience working in a team and problem solving. I have
      been interested in tech for as long as I remember, Ive always been one to take things apart to see
      how they work and try and put them back together. In my off time you can usually find me with a 
      fishing pole in my hand, or behind a mouse and keyboard gaming. </p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>For this project we had to develop a single virtual pet that we would have to be able to take care of.
          We needed to create methods to effect variables like hunger, thirst, boredom etc. The console would 
          ask for input from the user then update the stats after every turn. The project had to run in 
          a loop with a tick method inceasing the variables slightly each turn.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>This project was very similar to virtual pet but we had to expand to take care of several pets. A 
          big goal for this project was to get more comfortable with test driven development, so I tried to
        build all of my methods, classes, variables, etc. through tests. With the project now being a Shelter
      instead of an individual pet I had to create a method to add and remove pets. Each individual pet also
    needed to be walked alone, so I had to figure out a way to only affect a single virtual pets stats. </p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>In this variation of the virtual pet shelter I have dogs, cats, robot dogs and robot cats who
          all have their own needs that have to be taken care of. This project shares mostly the same
        requirements as the shelter but here I have to use object oriented programming to group together
      methods and variables that some of the pets do share. An example of this is that only the 
    regular cats and dogs needed to eat and drink while the robot cats and dogs needed to be oiled and 
    maintenanced. </p>
